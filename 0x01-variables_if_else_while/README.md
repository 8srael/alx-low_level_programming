### 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

___Mandatory Tasks___

__for task 0 and 1 : This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed__

- [0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/8srael/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c) - print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.
- [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/8srael/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c) -  print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.
- [2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/8srael/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c) - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- [3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/8srael/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c) - prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
- [4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/8srael/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c) - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- [5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/8srael/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c) - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
- [6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/8srael/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c) - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.
- [7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/8srael/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c) - prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
- [8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/8srael/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c) - prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- [9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/8srael/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c) - prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers . Numbers must be separated by , followed by a space .

___Advanced Tasks___

- [100-print_comb3.c](https://github.com/8srael/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c) - prints all possible different combinations of two digits. `01` and `10` are considered the same combination of the two digits `0` and `1` .
- [101-print_comb4.c](https://github.com/8srael/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c) - prints all possible different combinations of three digits. 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2 .
- [102-print_comb5.c](https://github.com/8srael/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/102-print_comb5.c) - prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers . `00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1`
